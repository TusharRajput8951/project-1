    <h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Ride with purpose, respect the road, and honor the journey.</h2>
    <ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The Road is My Temple
            <p>Every ride is a form of worship. The hum of the engine, the curve of the road, and the wind on my face connect me to something deeper than just speed. I don’t just ride; I surrender to the path.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Brotherhood Beyond Borders
            <p>Whether it’s a fellow rider in the Himalayas or a stranger on a Royal Enfield in Kerala, every biker is family. We wave not out of courtesy but out of shared spirit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Respect All, Fear None
            <p>We don’t race to show off. We ride to discover. We respect pedestrians, drivers, animals, and the land we ride on. Our freedom comes with responsibility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Ride Hard, Ride Safe
            <p>Helmets are not an option; they’re a habit. Gear is our armor. Safety is our pride, not our weakness.</p>
        </li>
        <li>One Ride, Many Lessons
            <p>Every ride teaches patience, humility, and trust in your machine, your instincts, and the universe. Whether it’s rain, breakdowns, or blocked highways, we don’t complain; we adapt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>India is Our Playground
            <p>From Ladakh’s barren heights to Goa’s coastal curves, we ride not to escape life but to embrace its every shade. Every village, every city, and every chai stop has a story, and we are here to listen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Modesty Over Show-Off
            <p>Loud pipes don’t prove power; calm minds do. We don’t ride to show we are better; we ride because it makes us better.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
